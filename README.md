2D Enemy Demo
-------------

Welcome to a simple game I made with Unity to demonstrate A* pathfinding, enemy AI, and 2D character animation.  
In this game, you play as a ninja who has to defeat a robot dog, a ghost, and the demon squirrel!

Installation

To run this game in Unity, install Unity version 2019.2.8f1.  
Disclaimer: Newer versions of Unity do not support the version of the A* pathfinding asset for this game.  

Launch Unity once is installed. The Unity Hub dialog should appear.
Navigate to the Projects tab, then click the **ADD** button. Next, navigate to the **2D Enemy Demo** folder within this repo, and click open.

Next, press the play button, and watch out for the dog! He bites!
